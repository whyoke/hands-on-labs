# Hands-on Machine Learning Lab for Biomedical Engineering Students

This is part of the code for BME Lab at Mahidol University.

### Building Machine Learning Application with Gradio

Gradio is a powerful tool for creating web interfaces for machine learning models.
In this lab, students will learn to build practical medical applications using Gradio's intuitive interface.

### Generative AI

This lab will explore the practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Ollama and OpenWebUI.
Students will work with locally-hosted models, learning how to interact with them.
